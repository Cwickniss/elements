## Tim's Rules of LLM Prompting

- Any information you omit from your prompt will be inferred by the AI.
- Never give personal or confidential information to a public / free AI. Be aware!
- Maintain at least 2 "daily driver" LLMs at a paid tier for AB testing
- Speak to the LLM in the ways that are most comfortable (voice, text, image)
- Think in terms of meta prompting (optimizing your custom instructions; asking AI for a summary prompt)
- Apply a stream-of-consciousness technique to generate prompts
- Be on the lookout for signs of amnesia/hallucination and have a backup plan
- Don't forget to attribute AI enrichment
- Understand the particularities of each LLM and leverage them in multi-chat sessions
